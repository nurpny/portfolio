I remember being intrigued by my first programming experience in high school when I made a snake game. I entered college as more tech jobs were being outsourced, and didn't think there would be any engineering jobs left in North Ameria. HA!

At work, people often described me as analytical and tech savvy, and I got a chance to explore my technical abilities when I worked as a Business Intelligence analyst. After taking some online courses on SQL and Python, I knew I wanted more. Leaving my job mid-career was a scary thought, but with support of my family, I got the courage to take the plunge and join a coding bootcamp.

I decided to go to Grace Hopper out of many bootcamps in NYC, because it was the only women's bootcamp. I made a lot of life-long friends there, and am glad that I had such a positive sisterhood


When I'm not coding, you can probably find me eating and drinking beers with my friends. I also like to travel... Although many of my trips are on hold for now given the situation. I hope to start traveling again in the near future. My guilty pleasure is looking at dog photos or funny comics on instagram.
