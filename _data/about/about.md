I remember entering college as more tech jobs were being outsourced and thinking that there would not be any engineering jobs left in America. Obviously my fears were unfounded.

At work, people often described me as analytical and tech savvy, and I got a chance to explore my technical abilities when I worked as a Business Intelligence analyst. After taking some online courses on SQL and Python, I knew I wanted more. Leaving my job mid-career was a scary thought but with the support of my family, I got the courage to take the plunge and join a coding bootcamp.

I decided to go to Grace Hopper out of many bootcamps in NYC because it was the only women's bootcamp available. I enjoyed the support network unique to the program and made some great friends.

When I'm not coding, you can probably find me enjoying a beer with my friends and planning my next trip. Although many of my trips are on hold for now, I hope to start traveling again soon.
