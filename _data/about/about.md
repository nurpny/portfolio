I started exploring my technical abilities while working as a Business Intellligence analyst. After taking some online courses on SQL and Python, I knew I wanted more. Although leaving my job mid-career was scary, with the support of my family, I found the courage to take the plunge and enroll in a coding bootcamp.

I decided to attend the Grace Hopper Program because I knew learning with a supportive network of talented women coders would help me develop my skills.

I continue to work on various projects and explore different technologies, including this portfolio site made with Gatsby.

When I'm not coding, you can probably find me enjoying a beer with my friends and planning my next trip. Although many of my trips are on hold for now, I hope to start traveling again soon.

Please look around my site, and feel free to contact me via Linkedin or email.
